# Market Regime Detection via Volatility States and Signal Clustering

This project implements a data pipeline for detecting market regimes using financial time series volatility signals. It integrates statistical modeling, unsupervised clustering, and regime tagging to support economic insight, trading strategy adaptation, or portfolio reallocation decisions.

## Key Features
- EWMA and GARCH-based volatility estimation
- Regime classification using K-Means and Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Dynamic regime tagging and time-series visualization

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Sample data placeholder
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks demonstrating each modeling step
- `src/` — Modular Python scripts for preprocessing, modeling, and plotting

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
